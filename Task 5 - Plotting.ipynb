    "Much of the early scientific computing tools for Python were modeled on Matlab. This is most obvious in the naming of the package for plotting graphs - `matplotlib`. The subpackage `pyplot` is a nice way to use the package.\n",

    "There are a lot of settings and customisations you can make to a plot and there are [some tutorials you can follow](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/index.html). The easiest thing to do is often to [peruse the examples](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/index.html) and see if there's a feature you would like to use."
